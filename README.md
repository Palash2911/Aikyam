# Aikyam

### Problem Statement:
There is a lack of efficient and effective communication between NGOs and individuals who are interested in volunteering for social causes. This leads to a significant gap in finding and recruiting volunteers for various events and drives organized by NGOs.

### Proposed Solution:
To address this problem, an app is built using Flutter and Firebase, which serves as a platform for NGOs and individual users to connect and collaborate efficiently. The app provides a simple and user-friendly interface for NGOs to register and create posts about their events or drives, while individual users can browse through these posts and apply for volunteering. The app also allows for easy communication between NGOs and users, keeping them updated about the status of their applications and events. By facilitating effective communication and collaboration, the app aims to bridge the gap between NGOs and volunteers, promoting social causes and contributing to a better society.

### Functionality & Concepts used:

#### Frontend:
We used Flutter as the main framework for our app, as flutter works seamlessly for building cross-platform apps.
The front end was built by translating our UI designs into user-centric screens
and responsive designs using stateless and stateful widgets.

#### Backend:
The backend of the app is built using Firebase, as its a cloud-based platform that provides a range of tools and services for building scalable and secure apps. We used Firebase services such as authentication, database, storage, and messaging, which are used to implement the functionality of the app.

#### Programming languages and tools:
The frontend is created using Flutter as the Framework hence Dart was used as the main programming language. Dart is object-oriented and hence use of functions, polymorphism, inheritance is easy .

The backend of the app is built using Firebase's suite of tools and services, like Firebase Firestore, Firebase Cloud Store etc, which are designed to work seamlessly together to provide a complete backend solution for mobile apps.


walk us through steps we could take to test the solution on real users and provide me three such test cases with feedbacks we might recieve

- Conducted Usability testing:
by doing this we evaulated how easy it is for users for navigate through the app and if our app is user friendly. For this we asked users to perform some tasks like creating a post, applying for a post and setting up profile etc.

- feedback: The app has a very simple interface hence no problem while creating a post for the NGO side likewise its easy to apply for post as they were available on home screen

- A/B Testing : In this testing we asked users to use 2 different version of the app having having different UI for the Home screen especially the post format.
In the first version we had share, comments, apply, like in the same row which 
was clumsy and unclear
In the 2nd version we did a bit of UI Fixes and hence made the user experience smooth and hassle free.

## What is Our Problem?


## What is Our Solution?


## what inspired us to to select this specific goals and targets

We ourselves were unable to contribute to drives and events as we were unaware about them. The main issue was lack of awareness whihc was caused  as we had no connection or collaboration with any NGO's
Many NGO's are unable to conduct several events due to inadequate volunteers.
By observing the issues of Both NGO's and Individuals, we came to a solution of finding a pathway between the two

<!-- GOALS -->
## Our Goals
Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development."
The target under this goal is to "Enhance international support for implementing effective and targeted capacity-building in developing countries to support national plans to implement all the sustainable development goals.
our app is addressing this target by providing a platform that enables NGOs and individuals to connect and collaborate more efficiently, which can lead to better implementation of sustainable development goals. The app also promotes a global partnership for sustainable development by facilitating communication and collaboration between NGOs and volunteers from different parts of the world.
In addition, our app is also contributing to UN's Sustainable Development Goal 1, which is to "End poverty in all its forms everywhere." By providing a platform for NGOs to connect with volunteers, the app is helping to address social issues and promote volunteerism, which can contribute to reducing poverty and improving the overall well-being of society.

No Poverty               | Zero Hunger             |  Reduced Inequalities |  Responsible consumption and production                |  Climate action
